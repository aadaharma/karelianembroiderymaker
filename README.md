A Pattern Designer for Traditional Karelian Folk Embroidery
---
This is a Web Application for designing your very own Karelian Embroidery patterns. Karelian embroidery is a dying folk art, and this is my contribution for the reviving and uplifting of this handcraft technique. 
On this app, you can use templates to draw a pattern, change it's attributes and save it as a file. Later on, my mission is to add more interaction between users, maybe a gallery page and user pages for engagement and sharing patterns between users.
